# Twitter Clone

- A simple Twitter clone built in Ruby on Rails
- Based on the exercises described in Michael Hartl's excellent [tutorial series](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition)
- I decided to extend the automated testing further than was outlined in the tutorial series so I could get more up to speed with testing in general, employ some test driven development (TDD) and to get more familiar with RSpec
- To run tests clone the directory and run `bundle exec rspec`
- The project has also been [deployed live to Heroku](https://twitter-clone-cw.herokuapp.com)
